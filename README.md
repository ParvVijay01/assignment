A new Flutter assignment.

## Getting Started

This project is an assignment given to me for a hiring process.

A few resources to used for completion of the project:

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
